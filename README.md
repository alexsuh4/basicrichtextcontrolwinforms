What
Yet another Rich Text Box .NET Winforms Control with HTML capacity.

Why 
Becouse the default rich textbox that comes with the winforms tool set can work only with RTF format , which is not very usfeull.

How
Just add a reference to your project, drop the control (or init in code , whatever is your thing) and you are good to go 

More
I used an exising project that convert an RTF format into HTML , so , nothing fancy here . 
But its usefull , albeit in a limited way.
